# What is Writer

Writer is a Desktop markdown application made for Vim enthusiasts. I use Vim constantly so I made an app that supports vim so that I can write in peace. Currently available only on macOS. It has the basic markdown feature.

Writr is a simple **note-taking app** that uses **Markdown** syntax to format your notes.

You can create your first note by clicking on the top-left icon on the sidebar, or delete one by clicking on top right icon.

Following there's a quick overview of the currently supported Markdown syntax.

## Text formatting

This is a **bold** text.
This is an _italic_ text.

Here are all the heading formats currently supported by **_NoteMark_**:

# Heading 1
