# Writer

> Built with love by A passionate Vim enthusiast, Emran Hossain.

Welcome to **Writer**. This is a _markdown_ Text editor. With the power of the built in LSP (language server protocol), Syntax highlighting and completions you can build your coding documentation, as a student or a learner practice your DSA, or document your workflow in general using the markdown syntax and Vim motions.

# What is Writer

Writer is a Desktop markdown application made for Vim enthusiasts. I use Vim constantly so I made an app that supports vim so that I can write in peace. Currently available only on macOS. It has the basic markdown feature.

**How does it fit into my workflow?** Most of my notes are not high level documentation, they are brain dumps, disposable thoughts, or just to remember something, I write it. Most note taking apps does not fit into what I do as a developer. So I made very minimal markdown writer that is very suitable for disposable work. It has LSP so writing code or praciticing leetcode is easier and fast.
