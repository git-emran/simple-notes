# What is Writer

Writer is a Desktop markdown application made for Vim enthusiasts. I use Vim constantly so I made an app that supports vim so that I can write in peace. Currently available only on macOS. It has the basic markdown feature.

**How does it fit into my workflow?** Most of my notes are not high level documentation, they are brain dumps, disposable thoughts, or just to remember something, I write it. Most note taking apps does not fit into what I do as a developer. So I made very minimal markdown writer that is very suitable for disposable work. It has LSP so writing code or praciticing leetcode is easier and fast.
